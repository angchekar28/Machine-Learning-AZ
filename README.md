# Machine Learning A-Z: AI & Python [2025] - Course Codes

This repository contains the code implementations from the **Machine Learning A-Z: AI & Python [2025]** course on Udemy, led by **Kirill Eremenko** and **Hadelin de Ponteves, Hon. PhD**. The course provides hands-on experience in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras**.

## Course Overview

The course covers a wide range of machine learning topics, from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques, including:

- **Supervised Learning**  
  Learn how to implement algorithms for classification and regression tasks, such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.

- **Unsupervised Learning**  
  Dive into clustering techniques like K-means and hierarchical clustering, and dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA, Kernel PCA, and LDA.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
  Explore text data manipulation with **NLTK**, focusing on tasks like tokenization, stemming, and sentiment analysis.

- **Computer Vision**  
  Build image classifiers and object detection models using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

- **Model Selection & Optimization**  
  Learn how to tune hyperparameters, evaluate model performance with cross-validation, and optimize models for real-world applications.
